# Abstract

As athletes continue to look to improve their game in many facets, one of the main emerging ways to help them do this is through technology. For basketball players, one of the main points of training is having as consistent of a shot as possible. By using both accelerometer and neuromuscular data from numerous sensors, this project aims to use that data to help basketball players ensure that their shots are as consistent as possible from a neuromuscular standpoint as well as in terms of arm trajectory. This will be done by collecting data from IMU and STMicroelectronics-QVAR sensors, and processing it to classify different characteristics of an athlete's basketball shot form.
