# Abstract

As athletes continue to look to improve their game in many facets, one of the main emerging ways to help them do this is through technology. For basketball players, one of the main points of training is having as consistent of a shot as possible. By using both accelerometer and neuromuscular data from numerous sensors, this project aims to use that data to help basketball players ensure that their shots are as consistent as possible from a neuromuscular standpoint as well as in terms of arm trajectory. This is done by collecting data from IMU and STMicroelectronics-QVAR sensors, and processing it to classify different characteristics of an athlete's basketball shot form. The collected data is then consolidated into one main signal to characterize the "macro" movement of the player's arm (IMU Acceleration Data), and one main signal to characterize the "micro" movement (QVAR Neuromuscular Data). These two characterizing signals are then analyzed using a cosine similarity function, which identifies all of the shots taken and calculates a consistency score, which is then outputted to give the user a notion of the level of consistency of their shots from an acceleration and neuromuscular standpoint. This data can then be used to supplement an athlete's training regimen and improve their form consistency over time.
